## Advanced Penetration Testing Labs (Hack The Box)
*January 2025*

This project involved a series of advanced labs simulating real-world corporate networks. I moved beyond simple exploits to focus on multi-stage attack paths and stealthy persistence.

Key Accomplishments:

Successfully executed privilege escalation on multiple Linux targets using kernel exploits and misconfigured services.

Performed web application attacks, including SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), to gain initial footholds.

Documented each step of the exploit chain, creating detailed write-ups that serve as a personal knowledge base for future engagements.

Skills: Ethical Hacking, Linux Privilege Escalation, Web Exploitation, Reporting

## Digital Forensics & Insider Threat Investigation
*April 2025*

I conducted a forensic investigation on a disk image to uncover evidence of data exfiltration by an insider threat. The goal was to build a complete timeline of events and present it in a court-admissible format.

Key Accomplishments:

Recovered over 50 deleted files, including critical documents and chat logs, using file carving techniques in Autopsy.

Analyzed file metadata and system logs to identify timestamp manipulation, proving intent to deceive.

Authored a full forensic report detailing the chain of custody, evidence found, and a minute-by-minute timeline of the breach.

Skills: Digital Forensics, File Carving, Metadata Analysis, Chain of Custody, Autopsy, FTK Imager

## Secure Personal Network with VPN & Firewall
*February 2025*

To deepen my understanding of network security, I designed and deployed a custom, secure network infrastructure from scratch on a cloud server.

Key Accomplishments:

Deployed and configured an OpenVPN server to encrypt all personal network traffic.

Integrated Pi-hole for DNS-level blocking of ads and malicious trackers, enhancing both security and privacy.

Hardened the server by creating and implementing strict firewall rules with UFW and writing Bash scripts for automated maintenance.

Skills: Networking, OpenVPN, Pi-hole, UFW Firewall, Bash Scripting, Linux Administration

## OSINT Threat Intelligence & Footprint Audit
*April 2025*

I performed a comprehensive Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigation on myself to simulate how an adversary would gather reconnaissance for a targeted attack.

Key Accomplishments:

Uncovered and documented publicly exposed personal data points that could be leveraged in social engineering attacks.

Successfully removed or obfuscated sensitive information from public sources, reducing my personal attack surface.

Created a threat brief outlining potential attack vectors, which could be used to train others on digital privacy risks.

Skills: OSINT, Threat Intelligence, Social Engineering, Privacy Analysis

## Incident Response Simulation: Phishing Attack
*July 2025*

In a sandboxed environment, I managed a simulated phishing attack from detection to remediation to test my incident response capabilities.

Key Accomplishments:

Used Splunk to query logs and rapidly identified the initial point of compromise and lateral movement.

Followed a standard IR plan to contain the threat by isolating the "infected" host from the network.

Developed a post-incident report with actionable recommendations for improving security posture, such as better email filtering and user training.

Skills: SIEM (Splunk), Incident Response, Phishing Detection, Post-Incident Reporting
